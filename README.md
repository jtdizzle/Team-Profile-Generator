## Installation

You must have node installed to use this program.

At the command line terminal of your choice type the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/baker-ling/team_profile_generator
cd team_profile_generator
npm install
```

## Usage

At the directory where you installed this program, type the following on the command-line:

```
node index.js
```

The program will ask you a series of questions about the team, starting with the team name and information about the team manager. After you finish entering the information for a team member, the program will ask if you want to add another team member. You can answer 'no' to that question to stop and have the program generate the file, or answer 'yes' to continue.

When you answer 'no' to adding another team member, the program will create the output file `index.html` in the `dist/` subdirectory. Note that it will overwrite any previous files you may have left there.
